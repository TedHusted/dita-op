<h1 class="topictitle1">What are maps?</h1>


<div><p>DITA maps are documents that collect and organize references to
DITA topics to indicate the relationships among the topics. They can also
serve as outlines or tables of contents for DITA deliverables and as build
manifests for DITA projects.</p>

<p>DITA maps represent the architecture of an information set – what topics
are needed, in what order or relationships, to support a particular set of
user goals or other requirements. </p>

<p>Maps describe the context in which the topics will be read – the audience,
platform, relationships, requirements of the information set. In this way,
the topics themselves become relatively context-free, and can be more easily
used and reused in many different contexts, as defined by maps.</p>

<p>Maps draw on a rich set of existing best practices and standards for defining
information models, such as hierarchical task analysis. They also support
the definition of non-hierarchical relationships, such as matrices and groups,
which provide a set of capabilities that has some similarities to RDF (Resource
Description Framework) and ISO (International Standards Organization) topic
maps. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/RDF/</a> and <a href="http://www.topicmaps.org/" target="_blank">http://www.topicmaps.org/</a> for more information
on those standards.</p>

<p>A DITA map file references one or more DITA topic files using &lt;topicref&gt;
elements. The &lt;topicref&gt; elements can be nested or otherwise organized
to reflect the desired relationships between the referenced topics. Map files
need to have a file extension of .ditamap to be processed properly.</p>
