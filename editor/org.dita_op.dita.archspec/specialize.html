<h1 class="topictitle1">What is specialization?</h1>


<div><p>Specialization allows you to define new kinds of information (new
structural types or new domains of information), while reusing as much of
existing design and code as possible, and minimizing or eliminating the costs
of interchange, migration, and maintenance. </p>

<p>Specialization is used when new structural types or new domains are needed.
 DITA specialization can be used when you want to make changes to your design
for the sake of increased consistency or descriptiveness or have extremely
specific needs for output that cannot be addressed using the current data
model.  Specialization is not recommended for simply creating different output
types as DITA documents may be transformed to different outputs without resorting
to specialization (see <a href="customize.html" title="When you just need a difference in output, you can use DITA customization to override the default output without affecting portability or interchange, and without involving specialization.">Customization</a>).</p>

<p>There are two kinds of specialization hierarchy: one for structural types
(with topic or map at the root) and one for domains (with elements in topic
or map at their root, or the attributes props or base). Structural types define
topic or map structures, such as concept or task or reference, which often
apply across subject areas (for example, a user interface task and a programming
task may both consist of a series of steps). Domains define markup for a particular
information domain or subject area, such as programming, or hardware. Each
of them represent an “is a” hierarchy, in object-oriented terms, with each
structural type or domain being a subclass of its parent. For example, a specialization
of task is still a task; and a specialization of the user interface domain
is still part of the user interface domain.</p>

<p>Use specialization when you are dealing with new semantics (new, meaningful
categories of information, either in the form of new structural types or new
domains). The new semantics can be encoded as part of a specialization hierarchy,
that allows them to be transformed back to more general equivalents, and also
ensures that the specialized content can be processed by existing transforms. </p>
