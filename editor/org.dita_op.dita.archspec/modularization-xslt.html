<h1 class="topictitle1">Modularization in XSLT</h1>


<div><p>Stylesheet support in XSLT for DITA specializations can be applied
using the same principles as for the DTDs or Schemas, resulting in stylesheets
that are easy to maintain and that will support any subsequent specialization
with a minimum of effort.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Specification of module definition</h2>              <p>A
specialization-aware template for XSLT has this form of match pattern: </p>
 
     <pre class="pre">&lt;xsl:template match="*[contains(@class,' topic/section ')]"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
       <p>The XSLT match statement that associates
the style to the element does not use a literal match to the element name.
Instead, based on an element having the defaulted value <samp class="codeph">class="-
topic/section reference/refsyn "</samp> (for example) this rule will
trigger on the <span class="q">" topic/section "</span> value (note the required space delimiters
in the match string) and perform the associated template actions, regardless
of what the actual element name is.</p>
       <p>The XPath pattern in this
example effectively reads, "Selects any element whose class attribute
contains the space-delimited substring <span class="q">"topic/section"</span>."</p>
   
 </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Assembly rules for XSLT</h2>              <p>XSLT pattern
matching is the basis for DITA's specialization-aware processing. As
such, the base XSLT stylesheet for a DITA topic should minimally support any
specialization, no matter how far removed in generations from the archetype
topic.</p>
       <p>To support a newly-specialized DITA DTD or Schema that
has been specialization-enabled with unique class attribute values, create
a module that will contain ONLY the templates required for the uniquely new
elements in the specialization. This is similar to the mod files that declare
the unique elements in the specialization. The name of this module should
be the same as the root name for the specialization module. In the case of
DITA's reference DTD, the element declarations are in reference.mod and
the corresponding delta rules for XSLT are in reference.xsl.</p>
       <p>Next,
create an <span class="q">"override"</span>XSLT stylesheet that starts off with the xsl:import
instruction, naming the XSLT file used by this specialization's parent
DTD. This import picks up support for all elements that are common with the
parent DTD. Then add another xsl:import instruction in sequence, naming the
XSLT delta module that you created previously. Additionally you can add imports
for any domain-specific templates that need to be applied with this shell.
Then copy in the XSLT templates for any previously defined support that needs
to be associated <em>uniquely</em> to the new element names, and rename the
match pattern strings as needed to the new specialized values for each new
element. These added XSLT templates are deltas for the new stylesheet, much
as specialized DTDs build on previous DTDs by adding delta element definitions.
For XSLT support, you only need to define templates if you need new behavior
or if you need to modify the behavior of an ancestor element's processing.</p>
 
     <p>Because this process reuses a great deal of previous behaviors, the
time spent supporting the delta changes is minimal.</p>
       <p>To use a
specialization-enabled XSLT stylesheet with a specialized DITA topic, simply
associate it to the topic using either the W3C defined stylesheet link processing
instruction or by following configuration rules for your processing tools
(usually an XSLT processing utility such as saxon or xsltproc).</p>
