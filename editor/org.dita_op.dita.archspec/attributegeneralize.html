<h1 class="topictitle1">Attribute generalization</h1>


<div><p>Attributes specialized from props or base can be generalized using
a special attribute generalization syntax. Specialization-aware processes
should be able to recognize and process both the specialized and generalized
forms of an attribute as being equivalent in their values.</p>

<p>When generalized, specialized attribute values are added to the end of
their target ancestor attribute, within parentheses preceded by the name of
the specialized attribute. For each attribute that has been generalized, a
separate label and parentheses-enclosed set of values is added to the ancestor
attribute.</p>

<div class="p">For example, given that "jobrole" is an attribute specialized from "person",
which in turn is specialized from "props":<br /><ul>
<li>jobrole="programmer" can be generalized to person="jobrole(programmer)"
or to props="jobrole(programmer)"</li>

<li>props="jobrole(programmer)" can be respecialized to person="jobrole(programmer)"
or to jobrole="programmer"</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Generalization and respecialization can use the domains attribute to determine
the ancestry of role, and therefore the validity of person as an intermediate
target for generalization.</p>

<p>Generalized attributes are typically not expected to be authored or edited
directly, but to preserve the values of the specialized attributes while the
document is temporarily in a generalized form.</p>

<p>If a single element contains values for an attribute in more than one syntax,
that is an error. For example &lt;p person="role(programmer)"
role="admin"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; both provide values for the role attribute, but one
in a generalized syntax and one in a specialized syntax. This is an error
condition, since it means the document has been only partially generalized,
or has been generalized and then edited using a specialized document type. </p>
