<h1 class="topictitle1">Why specialization?</h1>


<div><p>Specialization can have dramatic benefits for the development of
new document architectures.</p>

<div class="p">Among the benefits:<br /><ul>
<li>No need to reinvent the base vocabulary - Create a module in 1/2 day with
10 lines vs. 6 months with 100s of lines; allows faster design iterations
and scalable prototyping; automatically pick up changes to the base</li>

<li>No impact from other designs that customize for different purposes - Avoid
enormous, kitchen-sink vocabularies; Plug in the modules for your requirements
 </li>

<li>Interoperability at the base type - Guaranteed mapping from specialized
type documents to base type documents</li>

<li>Reusable type hierarchies - Share understanding of information across
groups, saving time and presenting a consistent picture to customers  </li>

<li>Output tailored to customers and information - More specific search, filtering,
and reuse that is designed for your customers and information not just the
common denominator  </li>

<li>Consistency - Both with base standards and within your information set
 </li>

<li>Learning support for new writers  - Instead of learning standard markup
plus specific ways to apply the markup, writers get specific markup with guidelines
built in  </li>

<li>Explicit support of different product architectural requirements  - Requirements
of different products and architectures can be supported and enforced, rather
than suggested and monitored by editorial staff </li>

</ul>
