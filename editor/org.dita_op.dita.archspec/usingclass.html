<h1 class="topictitle1">Using the class attribute</h1>


<div><p>Applying an XSLT template based on class attribute values allows
a  transform to be applied to whole branches of element types, instead of
 just a single element type.</p>

<p>Wherever you would check for element name (any XPath statement that  contains
an element name value), you need to change this to instead check the contents
of the element's class attribute. Even if the  element is unknown to the processor,
the class attribute can let the transform know  that the element belongs to
a class of known elements, and can be safely  treated according to the rules
for that class.</p>

<p>Be sure to include a leading and trailing blank in your class attribute
 string check. Otherwise you could get false matches (without the blanks,
 'task/step' would match on both 'task/step' and on 'notatask/stepaway').</p>

<p>Make sure that when you create a transform that targets more than one type
that you give the more specific rules a higher precedence to avoid conflicts.
For example, when you combine the existing processing rules for topics with
more specific processing rules for tasks, use a shell file to import both
sets of rules and use import precedence to ensure task-specific rules will
not conflict with generic rules for topics.</p>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example: match statement for list items</h2><pre class="codeblock">&lt;xsl:template match="li"&gt;</pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;xsl:template match="*[contains(@class,' topic/li ')]"&gt;</pre>
<p>This match statement will work on any li element it encounters. It will
 also work on step and appstep elements, even though it doesn't know what
 they are specifically, because the class attribute tells the template what
 they are generally.</p>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example: match statement for steps</h2><pre class="codeblock">&lt;xsl:template match="*[contains(@class,' task/step ')]"&gt;</pre>
<p>This
match statement won't work on generic li elements, but it will work  on both
step elements and appstep elements; even though it doesn't know  what an appstep
is, it knows to treat it like a step.</p>
