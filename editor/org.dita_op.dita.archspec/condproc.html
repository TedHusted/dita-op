<h1 class="topictitle1">Conditional processing (profiling)</h1>


<div><p>Conditional processing, also known as profiling, is the filtering
or flagging of information based on processing-time criteria. </p>

<p>DITA tries to implement conditional processing in a semantically meaningful
way: rather than allowing arbitrary values to accumulate in a document over
time in a general-purpose processing attribute, with meaning only to the original
author, we encourage the authoring of metadata using specific metadata attributes
on content. These metadata values can then be leveraged by any number of processes,
including filtering, flagging, search, and indexing, rather than being suitable
for filtering only.</p>

<div>
<p>For a topic or topicref, the audience, platform, and product metadata can
be expressed with attributes on the topic or topicref element or with elements
within the topic prolog or topicmeta element. While the metadata elements
are more expressive, the meaning of the values is the same, and can be used
in coordination: for example, the prolog elements can fully define the audiences
for a topic, and then metadata attributes can be used within the content to
identify parts that apply to only some of those audiences.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">audience</dt>

<dd>The values from the enumerated attributes of the audience metadata element
have the same meaning when used in the audience attribute of a content element.
For instance, the "user" value has the same meaning whether appearing in the
type attribute of the audience element for a topic or in the audience attribute
of a content element. The principle applies to the type, job, and experience
level attributes of the audience element. <p>The values in the audience attribute
may also be used to reference a more complete description of an audience in
an audience element. Use the name of the audience in the audience element
when referring to the same audience in an audience attribute.</p>
<p>The audience
attribute takes a blank-delimited list of values, which may or may not match
the name value of any audience elements.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">platform</dt>

<dd>The platform might be the operating system, hardware, or other environment.
This attribute is equivalent to the platform element for the topic metadata.</dd>

<dd class="ddexpand"><p>The platform attribute takes a blank-delimited list of values, which
may or may not match the content of a platform element in the prolog.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">product</dt>

<dd>The product or component name, version, brand, or internal code or number.
This attribute is equivalent to the prodinfo element for the topic metadata.</dd>

<dd class="ddexpand"><p>The product attribute takes a blank-delimited list of values, which
may or may not match the value of the prodname element in the prolog.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">rev</dt>

<dd>The identifier for the revision level. For example, if a paragraph was
changed or added during revision 1.1, the rev attribute might contain the
value "1.1". </dd>


<dt class="dlterm">otherprops</dt>

<dd>A catchall for metadata qualification values about the content. This attribute
is equivalent to the othermeta element for the topic metadata. </dd>

<dd class="ddexpand"><p>The attribute takes a blank-delimited list of values, which may or
may not match the values of othermeta elements in the prolog. </p>
<p>For example,
a simple otherprops value list: <samp class="codeph">&lt;codeblock otherprops="java cpp"&gt;</samp></p>
<p>The
attribute can also take labelled groups of values, but this syntax is deprecated
in DITA 1.1 in favor of attribute specialization. The labelled group syntax
is similar to the generalized attribute syntax and may cause confusion for
processors. A labelled group consists of a string value followed by an open
parenthesis followed by one or more blank-delimited values followed by a close
parenthesis. The simple format is sufficient when an information set requires
only one additional metadata axis, in addition to the base metadata attributes
of product, platform, and audience. The full format is similar to attribute
specialization in that it allows two or more additional metadata axes. For
example, a complex otherprops value list: <samp class="codeph">&lt;codeblock otherprops="proglang(java
cpp) commentformat(javadoc html)"&gt;</samp></p>
<p />
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">props</dt>

<dd>A generic attribute for conditional processing values. In DITA 1.1, the
props attribute can be specialized to create new conditional processing attributes.</dd>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Using metadata attributes</h2>

<div>
<p>Each attribute takes zero or more space-delimited string values. For example,
you can use the product attribute to identify that an element applies to two
particular products. </p>

<div class="fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Example source</span>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;p audience="administrator"&gt;Set the configuration options:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li product="extendedprod"&gt;Set foo to bar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li product="basicprod extendedprod"&gt;Set your blink rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do some other stuff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li platform="Linux"&gt;Do a special thing for Linux&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="processingmetadataattributes"><a name="processingmetadataattributes"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Processing metadata attributes</h2>

<div>
<div class="p">At processing time, you specify the values you want to exclude and the
values you want to flag using a conditional processing profile (described
in the DITA Language Specification). For example, a publisher
producing information for a mixed audience using the basic product could choose
to flag information that applies to administrators, and exclude information
that applies to the extended product, and express those choices in a conditional
processing profile like this:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;prop att="audience" val="administrator" action="flag" &gt;
  &lt;startflag&gt;ADMIN&lt;/startflag&gt;
&lt;/prop&gt;
&lt;prop att="product"  val="extendedprod"  action="exclude"/&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>At output time, the paragraph is flagged, and the first list item is excluded
(since it applies to extendedprod), but the second list item is still included
(even though it does apply to extendedprod, it also applies to basicprod,
which was not excluded).</p>

<div class="p">The result should look something like: <div class="figborder">
<div class="p"><strong>ADMIN</strong> Set the configuration options: <br /><ul>
<li>Set your blink rate</li>

<li>Do some other stuff </li>

<li>Do a special thing for Linux</li>

</ul>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="filteringlogic"><a name="filteringlogic"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Filtering logic</h2>

<div>
<div class="p">When deciding whether to exclude a particular element, a process should
evaluate each attribute, and then evaluate the set of attributes:<br /><ul>
<li>If all the values in an attribute have been set to "exclude", the attribute
evaluates to "exclude"</li>

<li>If any of the attributes evaluate to exclude, the element is excluded.</li>

</ul>
 For example, if a paragraph applies to three products and the publisher
has chosen to exclude all of them, the process should exclude the paragraph;
even if the paragraph applies to an audience or platform that you aren't excluding.
But if the paragraph applies to an additional product that has not been excluded,
then its content is still relevant for the intended output and should be preserved.</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="flagginglogic"><a name="flagginglogic"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Flagging logic</h2>

<div>
<p>When deciding whether to flag a particular element, a process should evaluate
each value. Wherever a value that has been set as flagged appears in its attribute
(for example, audience="ADMIN") the process should add the flag. When multiple
flags apply to a single element, multiple flags should be output, typically
in the order they are encountered.</p>

<p>Flagging could be done using text (for example, bold text against a colored
background) or using images. When the same element evaluates as both flagged
and filtered (for example, flagged because of an audience attribute value
and filtered because of its product attribute values), the element should
be filtered.</p>
