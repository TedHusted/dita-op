<h1 class="topictitle1">Modularization in CSS</h1>


<div><p>Stylesheet support in CSS for DITA specializations can be applied
using the same principles as for the DTDs or Schemas, resulting in stylesheets
that are easy to maintain and that will support any subsequent specialization
with a minimum of effort.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Specification of module definition</h2>              <p>A
specialization-aware property for CSS has this form of selector: </p>
    
  <pre class="pre">*[class~="topic\/section"]   {
  margin-top: 12pt;
  display: block;
}</pre>
       <p>The CSS selector that associates the style to the element
does not use a literal match to the element name. Instead, based on an element
having the defaulted value <samp class="codeph">class="- topic/section reference/refsyn "</samp> (for
example) this rule will trigger on the <span class="q">"topic/section"</span> value (or <span class="q">"word"</span>)
and perform the associated styling or transform, regardless of what the actual
element name is.</p>
       <p>Note that the attribute string must contain
an escape character for the <span class="q">"/"</span> character which is otherwise not valid
in a CSS selector.</p>
       <p>The selector pattern in this example effectively
reads, in CSS terminology, "Selects any element with a class attribute
that contains the word topic\/section."</p>
<p>Not all CSS systems can
match based on values that are not physically present in the instance document.
Since the class attribute values in DITA are typically provided by default
declarations in the DTD or schema, not all CSS systems can match directly
on DITA source. </p>
<p>When direct specialization-aware matches are not possible,
alternatives include normalization (preprocessing the DITA source to push
values from the DTD or schema directly into the instance) or the use of element-name-based
rules.</p>
<p>Element-name-based rules will not be specialization-aware. Your
calling-stylesheet will have to import each additional stylesheet required
by the scope of specialized topics and vocabularies, each explicitly defined
using element-name selectors. In this scheme, unsupported new elements will
have no rendering properties associated, whereas in the specialization-aware
systems such elements can fall back to a rule that triggers off a previously-supported
value in the class attribute string.</p>
           </div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Assembly rules for CSS</h2>              <p>CSS supports
specialization similarly to XSLT. This document describes a best practice
for naming and populating CSS stylesheets that follow the specialization design
pattern for DITA DTDs and Schemas. Although this practice is not required
in order to implement CSS support for DITA, following the practice will make
subsequent specializations off the pattern to be done with minimal work, and
the files should be correspondingly easier to maintain.</p>
      
      <p>To support a newly-specialized DITA DTD or Schema that has been specialization-enabled
with unique class attribute values, create a module that will contain ONLY
the rules required for the uniquely new elements in the specialization. This
is similar to the mod files that declare the unique elements in the specialization.
The name of this module should be the same as the root name for the specialization
module. In the case of DITA's reference DTD, the element declarations
are in reference.mod and the corresponding delta rules for CSS are in reference.css.</p>
 
     <p>Next, create an <span class="q">"override"</span>CSS stylesheet that starts off with
the @import instruction, naming the CSS file used by this specialization's
parent DTD. This import picks up support for all elements that are common
with the parent DTD. Then add another @import instruction in sequence, naming
the CSS delta module that you created previously. Then copy in the CSS rules
for any previously defined support that need to be associated to the new element
names, and rename the selectors as needed to the new specialized values for
each new element. These added CSS rules are deltas for the new stylesheet,
much as specialized DTDs build on previous DTDs by adding delta element definitions.
This technique approximates the <span class="q">"fall-through"</span> support for what would
normally happen if the class attribute actually could map to the root class.</p>
 
     <p>Finally, if necessary, modify the behaviors of any of these new, delta
CSS rules. Because this process reuses a great deal of previous behaviors,
the time spent supporting the delta changes is minimal.</p>
       <p>To use
a specialization-enabled CSS stylesheet with a specialized DITA topic, simply
associate it to the topic using either the W3C defined stylesheet link processing
instruction or by following configuration rules for your editor or browser.</p>
