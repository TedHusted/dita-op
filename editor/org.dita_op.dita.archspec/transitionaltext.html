<h2 class="topictitle2">Why topic orientation in writing?</h2>


<div><p>Topic-oriented writing is a disciplined approach to writing that
emphasizes modularity and reuse of concise units of information--topics. A
topic is enough information to fully convey an idea or task in one reading.
Well-written topics can be reused in many contexts, as long as writers are
careful about a few things.</p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Conciseness and appropriateness</h3>                  <p>Readers
who are trying to quickly learn or do something will appreciate if that information
is written in a clear pattern that is easy to follow and contains only the
information they need to complete that task or grasp a fact. Recipes, encyclopedia
entries, car repair procedures--all are informational units that serve up
a uniquely focused unit of information that someone has consulted. Typically,
anything before or after in the sequence of the document is not of interest--the
topic contains everything pertinent to the reason the reader looked up the
topic in the first place.</p>
       </div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Locational independence</h3>                  <p>A well-written
topic is reusable in other context if it is <span class="q">"context free,"</span> meaning that
it can be inserted into a new document without revision of its content to
refer to a changed context. This is where the issue of transitional text is
perhaps most obvious to writers who are new to topic orientation. Phrases
like "As we considered earlier..." or "Now that you have completed
the initial step..." are likely to make little sense if a topic is reused
in a new context in which those preliminary conditions are different or perhaps
no longer existent. A well-written topic will read appropriately in any new
context because the writing style within it does not lead the reader outside
of the topic.</p>
       </div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Navigational independence</h3>                  <p>Most
HTML web pages are a mixture of both content and navigation, with the contained
links representing the web of reading sequences and choices that a reader
can make as he or she navigates through a web site. A standalone topic obviously
should not have any navigation within it that would need to be changed if
the topic were used in a different context. The DITA design supports this
separation of navigation from topics through the use of ditamaps, which represent
how topics should be organized for particular information deliverables. However,
it is still tempting for writers to want to provide links within the content
of a topic that allow a reader to consult external resources. DITA does not
prohibit such linking, and in fact the markup allows writers to indicate that
such links are external--choosing them opens a new browser window rather than
taking the reader on a navigational tangent. A well-written DITA topic generally
eschews internal linking to other topics within the document set--these are
best supported through the map, which allows the topics to be used in any
context without internal revision.</p>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Transitional text workarounds</h2>


<div><p>Topic orientation does not mean that transitions can't be
authored in DITA. The key to providing both locational independence and intentional
sequences is the adroit use of DITA markup features.</p>

<p>For DITA 1.1, the print attribute on the topicref element of a ditamap
now allows a new value of <span class="q">"printonly,"</span> which directs processing to skip
such a topic if the map is instead being output to an online format, for which
transitions are not necessary. A topic designated as printonly can be written
in whatever style an author feels necessary to let the topic serve as a transitional
topic in the flow of printed information. A DITA topic can be as minimal as
just a title, so you can craft your transitional topic to have just as much
information as necessary for this output-specific nonce.</p>

<p>Another strategy that you can use to insert transitional sequences into
a map of topics is the use of conditionality to include or exclude the content
of shortdescs or of paragraphs at the end of a topic. With rigor among your
team, this can be made to work, but it is not as general as the printonly
approach--if you share your conditionally marked topics with other business
partners or teams, you will have to instruct them on the proper runtime settings
to enable those conditions to be honored the way you intended. The printonly
method works generally for everyone who inherits maps that reference transitional
topics.<span /></p>
