<h1 class="topictitle1">Information typing</h1>


<div><p>Information typing is the practice of identifying types of topics
that contain distinct kinds information, such as concepts, tasks, and reference
information. Topics that answer different kinds of questions can be categorized
as different information types. The base topic types provided by DITA provide
a usable starter set that can be adopted for immediate authoring.</p>

<div class="p">Classifying
information by type helps authors:<br /><ul>
<li>Design new information more easily and consistently.  </li>

<li>Ensure the right design gets used for the kind of information (retrieval-oriented
structures like tables for reference information, simple sequences of steps
for task information) </li>

<li>Focus on tasks. </li>

<li>Factor out supporting concepts and reference information into other topics,
where they can be read if required and ignored if not. </li>

<li>Eliminate unimportant or redundant information. Identify common or reusable
subjects. </li>

</ul>
 </div>

<p>Information typing is part of the general authoring approach called structured
writing, which is used across the technical authoring industry to improve
information quality. It is based on extensive research and experience, including
Robert Horn's Information Mapping, and Hughes Aircraft's STOP (Sequential
Thematic Organization of Proposals).</p>

<p>Information types in DITA are expressed as topic types. The base topic
types provided by DITA can be used as a base for further specialization. New
information types that require different structures and semantics are directly
supported by topic type modules, each of which defines the specific markup
and structural rules required to describe a particular type of topic. These
modules can then be integrated into document types to support authoring information-typed
topics.</p>

The topic-oriented paradigm incorporated in DITA's design--and implicit in the bookmap model derived from DITA maps--favors a writing style that minimizes the use of such narrative filler between topics.">Transitional text</a></div>
