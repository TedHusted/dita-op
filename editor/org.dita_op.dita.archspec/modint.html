<h1 class="topictitle1">Modularization and integration of design</h1>


<div><p>Specialization hierarchies are implemented as sets of module files
that declare the markup and entities that are unique to each specialization.
The modules must be integrated into a document type before they can be used.</p>

<p>The separation of markup into modules, as with the XHTML modularization
initiative, (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/ ), allows easy reuse
of specific parts of the specialization hierarchy, as well as allowing easy
extension of the hierarchy (since new modules can be added without affecting
existing document types). This makes it easy to assemble design elements from
different sources into a single integrated document type.</p>
