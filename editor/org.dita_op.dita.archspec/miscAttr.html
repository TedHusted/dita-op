<h1 class="topictitle1">Miscellaneous Attributes</h1>


<div><p>DITA has several elements for supporting translation and for providing
additional classification or typing of a specific element.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous attributes of DITA elements include the following:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">xml:lang</dt>

<dd>The xml:lang attribute's behavior is described in detail in the XML specification: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-lang-tag" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-lang-tag</a> The
attribute identifies a language by means of the standard language and country
codes (as described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4646.txt" target="_blank">RFC
4646</a>). For instance, French Canadian would be identified
by the value <samp class="codeph">fr-ca</samp>. As is usual, the language applies to
the contained content and attributes of the current element and contained
elements, other than fragments that declare a different language.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">translate</dt>

<dd>Determines whether the element requires translation. A default value may
be inferred from the element type: for example, &lt;apiname&gt; may be untranslated
by default, whereas &lt;p&gt; may be translated by default. A list of suggested
defaults is provided in <a href="elementsMerged.html" title="This contains a list of all current TC-approved elements, divided up by module. It describes which are usually block elements and which are usually inline, and lists which elements should typically be translated by default.">All elements with translation properties</a>.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">dir</dt>

<dd>Determines the direction in which the content should be read.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">outputclass</dt>

<dd>The outputclass attribute provides a label on one or more element instances,
typically to specify a role or other semantic distinction. As the outputclass
attribute doesn't provide a formal type declaration or the structural consistency
of specialization, it should be used sparingly, often only as a temporary
measure while a specialization is developed. For example, &lt;uicontrol&gt; elements
that define button labels could be distinguished by adding an outputclass: <samp class="codeph">&lt;uicontrol
outputclass="button"&gt;Cancel&lt;/uicontrol&gt;</samp>. The outputclass value
could be used to trigger XSLT or CSS rules, as well as providing a mapping
to be used for future migration to a more specialized set of UI elements.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">base</dt>

<dd>A generic attribute that has no specific purpose, but is intended to act
as a base for specialized attributes that have a simple value syntax like
the conditional processing attributes (one or more alphanumeric values separated
by whitespace).</dd>

</dl>

<p>The attributes @xml:lang, @translate, and @dir are described in more detail
in <a href="translation.html" title="DITA has specific capabilities for preparing content for translation and working with multilingual content, including the xml:lang attribute, the dir attribute, and the translate attribute.">Translation</a>.</p>
