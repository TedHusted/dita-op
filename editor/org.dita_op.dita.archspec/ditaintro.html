<div><p>DITA is an architecture for creating topic-oriented, information-typed
content that can be reused and single-sourced in a variety of ways. It is
also an architecture for creating new topic types and describing new information
domains based on existing types and domains.</p>

<p>The process for creating new topic types and domains is called specialization.
Specialization allows the creation of very specific, targeted document type
definitions while still sharing common output transforms and design rules
developed for more general types and domains, in much the same way that classes
in an object-oriented system can inherit methods of ancestor classes.</p>

<p>DITA topics are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed, edited,
and validated with standard XML tools, although some features such as content
referencing and specialization may benefit from customized support.</p>

The following terms have specific meanings in DITA which should be understood before reading either the DITA markup specification or the DITA specialization specification.</li>

The following naming conventions and file extensions are in use by DITA.</li>

The OASIS DITA document types are implemented with a set of DTD modules. Some of these modules are used by every DITA document type; others are only used by topics or by maps, and some are only used in specific specializations.</li>
