<h1 class="topictitle1">IDs and references</h1>


<div><p>The DITA identity attribute provides mechanisms for identifying
content for retrieval or linking. The syntax for referencing IDs is consistent
regardless of the referencing mechanism.</p>

<p>The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element so the element
can be referenced. The scope of uniqueness for the id attribute depends on
the role of the element within the DITA architecture:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Topic IDs</dt>

<dd>Because topics are the basic units of information within DITA, the id
attribute for the topic must be unique within the document instance. <p>A
topic architecture assembles topics into a deliverable by reference. To ensure
that topics can be referenced, the id attribute is required on the topic element. </p>
<p>The
complete identifier for a topic consists of the combination of the URI for
the document instance, a separating hash character, and the topic id (as in <samp class="codeph">http://some.org/some/directory/topicfile.xml#topicid</samp>).
URIs are described in RFC 2396. As is typical with URIs, a relative URI can
be used as the identifier for the document instance so long as it is resolvable
in the referencing context. For instance, within a file system directory,
the filename of the document instance suffices (as in <samp class="codeph">some/directory/topicfile.xml#topicid</samp>).
Within the same document, the topic id alone suffices (as in <samp class="codeph">#topicid</samp>).
Where the topic element is the root element of the document instance, contexts
outside the document instance may omit the topic id when referring to the
topic element (as in <samp class="codeph">topicfile.xml</samp>). If the target contains
multiple peer topics organized by a &lt;dita&gt; element (as in the ditabase
document type), then the reference is resolved to the first topic in the target,
except in the case of topicrefs being resolved as inclusion directives (for
example during PDF output), in which case the entire target file is included,
regardless of whether a specific topic is targeted.</p>
<p>The topic id can be referenced by
other elements, including topicrefs, links, xrefs, or conrefs to the topic,
as well as being used as part of references to the topic content.</p>
<p>The
id attribute for DITA topics is of type ID in XML, and so must be unique within
the document instance.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Element IDs within a topic</dt>

<dd>Because topic content is always contained within a topic, the id attribute
for a topic content element must be unique only within the one topic that
immediately contains it. This approach ensures maintainable references to
content because the identifier remains valid so long as the document instance,
topic, and content exist. The position of the content within the topic and
the position of the topic within the document instance can change without
invalidating the content identifier. In addition, this approach avoids the
need to rewrite topic content ids to avoid naming collisions when aggregating
topics. <p>The id is optional
and need be added only to make the content referenceable.</p>
<p>The complete
identifier for topic content consists of the combination of the complete identifier
for the topic, a separating solidus (/), and the topic content id (as in <samp class="codeph">http://some.org/some/directory/topicfile.xml#topicid/contentid</samp>). As noted before, the topic identifier portion can use a relative URI for
the document instance in contexts where the relative URI can be resolved (as
in <samp class="codeph">some/directory/topicfile.xml#topicid/contentid</samp>).</p>
<p>The
containing topic id must always be included when referencing an element id.
Otherwise, a reference to another topic couldn't be distinguished from a reference
to an element within the same topic. For references within the same document
instance, the identifier for the document instance can be omitted altogether
(as in <samp class="codeph">#topicid/contentid</samp>).</p>
<p>The id attribute for elements
within DITA topics is not of type ID and is not required to be unique within
a document, although it should be unique within the topic.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Map IDs and element IDs within a map</dt>

<dd>For a map, the id of an element should be unique within the document instance.
This approach ensures that these elements can be referenced outside the map
without qualification by the map id. <p>For the anchor element, which exists
only to identify a position within a map as a target for references, the id
attribute is required. For the other elements, the id attribute is optional.</p>
<p>The
complete identifier for a map element consists of the combination of the absolute
URI for the map document instance and the element id (as in <samp class="codeph">http://some.org/some/directory/mapfile.xml#topicrefid</samp>). </p>
<p>The
id attributes for maps and anchors are of type ID and are required to be unique
within the document instance. The id attributes for other elements in map
are not of type ID and are not required to be unique.</p>
