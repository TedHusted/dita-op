<h1 class="topictitle1">Chunking</h1>


<div><p>Content may be chunked (divided or merged into new output documents)
in different ways for the purposes of authoring, for delivering content, and
for navigation. For example, something best authored as a set of separate
topics may need to be delivered as a single Web page. A map author can use
the chunk attribute to split up single documents into component topics or
combine multiple topics into a single document as part of output processing. </p>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Examples of use</h2>       <p>Here
are some examples of potential uses of the chunk attribute:</p>
       <dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Reuse of a nested topic</dt>

<dd>A content provider creates a set of topics as a single document. A reuser
wants to incorporate only one of the nested topics from the document. The
reuse can reference the nested topic from a DITA map, using the chunk attribute
to specify that the topic should be produced in its own document.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Identification of a set of topics as a unit</dt>

<dd>A curriculum developer wants to compose a lesson for a SCORM LMS (Learning
Management System) from a set of topics without constraining reuse of those
topics. The LMS can save and restore the learner’s progress through the lesson
if the lesson is identified as a referenceable unit. The curriculum developer
defines the collection of topics with a DITA map, using the chunk attribute
to identify the learning module as a unit before generating the SCORM manifest. </dd>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="usageofthechunkattribute"><a name="usageofthechunkattribute"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Usage of the chunk attribute</h2>


<div><p>When a set of topics is transformed for output using a map, the
map author may use the chunk attribute to override whatever default chunking
behavior applies. The chunk attribute allows the map author to request that
multi-topic documents be broken into multiple documents, and that multiple
individual topics be combined into a single document.  </p>

<p>Chunking is necessarily output transformation specific with chunked output
required for some and not supported for other types of output.  Chunking is
also implementation specific with some implementations supporting some, but
not all, chunking methods, or adding new implementation specific chunking
methods to the standard methods described in this specification. </p>

<div class="p">The value of the chunk attribute consists of one or more space delimited
tokens: <dl>
<dt class="dlterm">by–topic</dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “by–topic” token, a chunking
policy is established for the current topicref element where a separate output
chunk is produced for the target topic and each of its descendants. The policy
only applies for a chunk action of the current element (for example, to-content),
except when it is set on the map element, when the “by-topic” policy is established
for the entire map. </dd>


<dt class="dlterm">by–document </dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “by–document” token, a chunking
policy is established for the current topicref element where a single output
chunk is produced for the referenced document. The policy only applies for
a chunk action of the current element (for example, to-content), except when
it is set on the map element, when the “by-document” policy is established
for the entire map. </dd>


<dt class="dlterm">select–topic</dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “select–topic” token, an individual
topic, without any other topics (ancestors, descendents, or peers) from within
the same document, is selected. The value is ignored when the element it is
specified on does not point to a topic.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">select–document</dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “select–document” token, the
content for the referenced topic, as well as any other topics (ancestors,
descendents, or peers) contained within the same document are selected. The
value is ignored when the element it is specified on does not point to a topic.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">select–branch</dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “select–branch” token, an
individual topic as well as any nested topics it contains are selected. The
value is ignored when the element it is specified on does not point to a topic.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">to–content</dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “to–content” token, processing
generates a new chunk of content. When specified on the map element, creates
a single document that contains all the topics referenced by the map.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">to–navigation</dt>

<dd>When the chunk attribute value includes the “to–navigation” token, processing
generates new chunk of navigation (toc, related-links). When specified on
the map element, creates a single navigation chunk with the entire contents
of the map.</dd>

</dl>
Note that the set of select­–xxxxx token values are only useful
when addressing a topic in a document that contains multiple topics. </div>

<p>Some tokens or combinations of tokens may not be appropriate for all output
types. When unsupported or conflicting tokens are encountered during output
processing, warning or error messages should be produced.  Recovery from such
conflicts or other errors is implementation dependent. </p>

<p>There is no default value for the chunk attribute and the chunk attribute
does not inherit values from container elements. A default by-xxx policy for
an entire map may be established by setting the chunk attribute on the map
element. </p>

<p>When no chunk attribute values are given, chunking behavior is implementation
dependent and may vary for different implementations.  When variations of
this sort are not desired, a default for the entire map may be established
by including a chunk attribute value on the map element. </p>

<p>When creating new documents via chunk processing, the storage object name
or identifier (if relevant) is taken from the copyto  attribute if set, otherwise
the root name is taken from the id attribute  if the by-topic policy is in
effect and from the name of the referenced  document if the by-document policy
is in effect.</p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Implementation specific tokens and future considerations </h3>Additional
chunk tokens may be added to the DITA Standard in the future. Additional implementation
specific tokens may be defined as well. To avoid name conflicts between implementations
or with future additions to the standard, implementation specific tokens should
consist of a prefix that gives the name or an abbreviation for the implementation
followed by a colon followed by the chunking method name.  For example:  “acme:level2”
could be a token for the Acme DITA Toolkit that requests the “level2” chunking
method. </div>
