<h1 class="topictitle1">Topic properties in topics and maps</h1>


<div><p>The properties of a topic (including metadata attributes and metadata
elements) can be specified in the topic itself or in references to the topic
within maps.</p>

<p>Within a topic, properties can be expressed using <a href="metadataAttr.html" title="The metadata attributes express qualifications on the content. These qualifications can be used to modify the processing of the content.">metadata
attributes</a> on the topic element or using <a href="pubMetaElem.html" title="These elements provide standard information about the topic as a publication.">publication</a>, <a href="mgmtMetaElem.html" title="These elements provide a basis for managing the publication process for topics.">management</a>, or <a href="metaQualElem.html" title="These elements can be used to provide additional information about a topic, and may be used in conjunction with conditional processing attributes to provide more information about the attribute values.">metadata</a> elements
in the topic prolog. </p>

<p>DITA offers users three levels at which to apply topic properties. Topic
attributes and metadata elements can be defined within the topic itself. Properties
can also be set as attributes or subelements of a topicref that points to
the topic. In addition, properties can be set on container or ancestor elements
of the topicref within the map. Because the topics in a branch of the navigation
hierarchy typically have some common subjects or properties, this is a convenient
mechanism to set properties for a set of topics.</p>

<p>If a property is set in both the map and topic, the map properties are
additive if the property (such as the audience type) takes a list of values.
If, instead, the property (such as the importance) takes a single value, the
map property overrides the topic property. </p>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example of audience metadata in prolog and body</h2><p>Prolog
metadata elements can provide more information about values used in metadata
attributes on content. However, prolog metadata and attribute metadata can
also be used and expressed independently. The coordination shown here is possible
but is not required.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;prolog&gt;
  &lt;metadata&gt;
    &lt;audience name="AdminNovice"
              type="administrator"
              job="customizing"
              experiencelevel="novice"&gt;

  &lt;/metadata&gt;
&lt;/prolog&gt;
....
&lt;p audience="AdminNovice ProgrammerExp"&gt;This paragraph applies to both 
novice administrators and expert programmers&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>In the preceding
example, the attribute value "AdminNovice" is associated with the audience
element with the same name, which gives authors and processes more information
about the audience in question: in this case, that the "AdminNovice" audience
is administrators who are customizing and are new at it.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="topicmetainheritance.html">Metadata inheritance between maps and topics</a></strong><br />
The topicmeta element in maps contains numerous elements for the declaration of metadata. In general, specifying metadata in a topicmeta element is equivalent to specifying it in the topic, while allowing that topic to be reused in other maps where the metadata does not apply. Many items in the metadata also cascade to nested topic references within the map.</li>
</ul>

<div class="familylinks">
<div class="parentlink"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="commonmeta.html" title="The same metadata elements and many of the same attributes are available in both DITA topic types and DITA map types. The sharing of metadata elements allows the metadata assigned to a topic when it is created to be supplemented or overridden when the topic is included in a collection. The sharing of attributes allows processing behaviors, such as content reuse and conditional processing, to be implemented consistently across both maps and topics.">Metadata elements and common attributes</a></div>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Shared metadata elements, and the lockmeta attribute</h2>


<div><p>You can associate topic metadata with a topic or branch of topics
in a map. By default metadata in the map supplements or overrides metadata
in the topic. If the lockmeta attribute is set to "no", then the metadata
in the map will not take precedence over the metadata in the topic, and conflicts
will be resolved in favor of the topic.</p>

<p>In a map,
metadata elements are authored within a &lt;topicmeta&gt; element, which associates
metadata with the &lt;topicref&gt; or other element that contains it, plus the
other children of that element. For example, &lt;topicmeta&gt; in a &lt;relcolspec&gt;
can associate metadata with all the topics referenced in a &lt;reltable&gt; column. </p>

<p>The metadata elements in a map are the same as those in a topic, although
they may be in a different order. The map metadata also includes a short description
and alternate titles, which can override their equivalents in the content.
In sum, the map can override or supplement everything about a topic except
its content (in the topic's body element) and primary title.</p>
