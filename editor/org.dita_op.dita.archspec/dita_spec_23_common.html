<h1 class="topictitle1">Common DITA map attributes and metadata</h1>


<div><p>DITA maps have many of the same common attributes as DITA content,
but also have some additional ones for controlling the way relationships are
interpreted for different output purposes.</p>

<p>Because DITA maps may encode structures that are wholly or partially specific
to a particular medium or kind of output (for example, hyperlinked web pages
or printed books), DITA maps contain attributes to help processors interpret
the map for each kind of output. These attributes (such as print and toc)
are not available in DITA content: individual topics, once separated from
the high-level structures and dependencies associated with a particular kind
of output, should be entirely reusable across multiple media.</p>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Linking attributes</h2>


<div><p>The collection-type and linking attributes affect how related links
are generated for topics described in the map. </p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">collection-type</h3>The collection-type attribute indicates
how a particular set of sibling topicrefs relate to each other. The collection-type
attribute is set on the container element for the sibling topicrefs. The collection-type
value can indicate whether to generate links among the siblings, and what
kind of links to generate (for example, next and previous links for a sequence,
or sibling links for a family). The collection-type attribute can also indicate
how the parent topic should link to its children (for example, showing the
child links as a numbered list when the collection-type is sequence).Where
the collection-type attribute is available on elements that cannot directly
contain topicrefs (such as reltable and relcolspec), the behavior
of the attribute is reserved for future use.</div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">linking</h3><div class="p">By
default, relationships between topics in a map are reciprocal: children link
to parents and vice versa; next and previous topics in a sequence link to
each other; topics in a family link to their siblings; topics in table cells
of the same row in a relationship table link to each other. This default behavior
can be modified using the linking attribute, which lets a topic modify how
it participates in a relationship:<br /><ul>
<li> A topic reference with linking="none" does not exist in the map for the
purposes of calculating links</li>

<li>linking="sourceonly" means that the topic will link to its related topics
but not vice versa</li>

<li>linking="targetonly" means that the related topics will link to it, but
not vice versa</li>

<li>linking="normal" is the default, and means that linking will be reciprocal
(the topic will link to related topics, and they will link back to it)</li>

</ul>
You can also create links directly in a topic using the &lt;xref&gt; or &lt;link&gt;
elements, but in many cases map-based linking is preferable, because links
in topics create dependencies between topics that can hinder reuse.</div>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Navigation, media, and chunking attributes</h2>


<div><p>There are standard attributes available for identifying output-media-specific
content and for rechunking topics.</p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">toc, navtitle, locktitle</h3>Authors can exclude entries
from navigation output (such as an online table of contents, or a Web site
map) using the toc attribute. By default, hierarchies are included in navigation
output, and tables are excluded. <p>Authors can provide a shorter version
of the title for use in the navigation using the navtitle attribute. By default
the navtitle attribute is ignored, and used only to help the author keep track
of the target topic's title. The locktitle attribute can be set to ensure
that the navtitle takes effect and overrides any title values in the target
topic, or defined elsewhere in the topic reference metadata.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">print, search</h3>You can set attributes on a topic to
indicate whether it should be included in printed output and search indexes.</div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">chunk</h3>When a set of topics is transformed using a map,
multi-topic files can be broken into smaller files, and multiple individual
topics can be combined into a single larger file, using the chunk attribute.
There is no default value for the chunk attribute, but a default for an entire
map may be established by setting the chunk attribute on the map element or
a specialization. For a detailed description of the chunk attribute and its
usage see <a href="chunking.html" title="Content may be chunked (divided or merged into new output documents) in different ways for the purposes of authoring, for delivering content, and for navigation. For example, something best authored as a set of separate topics may need to be delivered as a single Web page. A map author can use the chunk attribute to split up single documents into component topics or combine multiple topics into a single document as part of output processing.">Chunking</a>.</div>

<div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">copy-to</h3>When a set of topics is transformed using a
map, duplicate topic versions can be created using the copy-to attribute.
The copied topic will have a new file name or location as provided in the
copy-to attribute, and the map can override the default title and shortdesc
for this particular copy by providing values for them in the map using the
topicref's navtitle and shortdesc. For information on how the copyto attribute
can be used with the chunk attribute see <a href="chunking.html" title="Content may be chunked (divided or merged into new output documents) in different ways for the purposes of authoring, for delivering content, and for navigation. For example, something best authored as a set of separate topics may need to be delivered as a single Web page. A map author can use the chunk attribute to split up single documents into component topics or combine multiple topics into a single document as part of output processing.">Chunking</a>.</div>

<div><p>DITA maps use the same metadata and reuse attributes that DITA
topics use.</p>

<div class="p"><br /><ul>
<li>product, platform, audience, otherprops, rev, status, importance, xml:lang,
translate</li>

<li>id, conref</li>

<li>props, base</li>

</ul>
DITA maps also use many of the same attributes that are used with link
or xref elements in DITA content:<br /><ul>
<li>format, scope, href, keyref, type, query</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>When new attributes are specialized off of props or base as a domain, they
may be incorporated into both map and topic structural types.</p>
