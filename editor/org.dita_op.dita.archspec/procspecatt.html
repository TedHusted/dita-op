<h1 class="topictitle1">Processing specialized attributes</h1>


<div><p>There are two kinds of specialized attributes: those specialized
from props for conditional processing, and those specialized from base for
other purposes.</p>

<p>Attributes specialized from props should inherit conditional processing
behavior by default, which should also work with their generalized forms.
In other words, values in a new attribute specialized from props can be conditionally
processed to filter or flag the element in exactly the same way as any other
conditional processing attribute (such as platform or audience).</p>

<p>Attributes specialized from base will have no processing by default; any
processing provided should be enabled to work with their generalized form
as well.</p>

<p>See <a href="attributegeneralize.html" title="Attributes specialized from props or base can be generalized using a special attribute generalization syntax. Specialization-aware processes should be able to recognize and process both the specialized and generalized forms of an attribute as being equivalent in their values.">Attribute generalization</a> for information on the
syntax of generalized attributes.</p>
