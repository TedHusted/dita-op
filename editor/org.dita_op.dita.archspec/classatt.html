<h1 class="topictitle1">The class attribute</h1>


<div><p>Each element declared in the DITA architecture has a class attribute.
This attribute  provides a mapping between the element's current name and
its more general equivalents. The more specialized the element type, the 
longer its class attribute value.</p>

<div class="p">For example, the class attribute for the task topic type's step element
is:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;!ATTLIST step         class  CDATA "- topic/li task/step "&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>This tells us that the step element is equivalent to the li element in
a  generic topic. It also tells us that step is equivalent to a step in a
 task topic, which we already knew, but it's worth noting this in the  attribute
because it enables round-trip migration between upper level and  lower level
types without loss of information. For example, if a user runs a  "generalize"
transform that maps all elements to their first class value,  but preserves
their content and attribute values, then the user can follow it up  with a
"specialize" transform that maps all elements to their last class  value (preserving
content and attribute values), and provide a full round trip for all content
between the two document types,  using nothing but two generic transforms
and the information in the class attribute.</p>

<p>The class attribute tells a processor what general
 classes of elements the current element belongs to. DITA  scopes values by
module type (for example topic type, domain type, or map type) instead of
document type, which lets document type developers combine multiple topic
types in a single document without complicating transform logic.</p>

<p>The sequence of the values is important because it tells processors which
value is the most general and which is most specific. This is  especially
important for "specializing" transforms, where you can apply a  general rule
that says: if the element doesn't have a mapping to the  target topic type,
simply use the last value of the class attribute (and  assume that the specialized
topic type is reusing some general element  declarations, which only have
mappings for the level at which they were  declared).</p>

<p>The class attribute value is provided as a default value that can be overridden
and is not fixed. The ability to change the class attribute becomes important
for mapping persistence through migration: when you migrate content to a 
more abstract element, you can preserve its more specialized history in the
 class attribute, allowing round-tripping of content between more specialized
and more general representations, so it can be processed by different applications
at whichever level they understand or support.</p>
