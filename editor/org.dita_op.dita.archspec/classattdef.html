<h1 class="topictitle1">Class attribute syntax</h1>


<div><p>The class attribute has a particular syntax that must be followed
for it to be processed correctly.</p>

<p>Every element must have a class attribute. The class attribute starts with
a "-" if it is declared in a structural module, or a "+" if it is declared
in a domain module. After the starting token are one or more blank-delimited
values, ending with a blank. Each value has two parts: the first part identifies
a specialization module, for example a topic type or domain name, and the
second part (after a / ) identifies an element type. Structural names are
taken from the root element for the topic type or map type. Domain names are
defined in the domain module.</p>

<p>Typically, the class attribute value should be declared as a default attribute
value in the  DTD or schema rather than directly in the document instance.
The class attribute should not be modified by the author. </p>

<div class="p"><div class="fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Example structural type element with class attribute</span>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;appstep class="- topic/li task/step bctask/appstep "&gt;A specialized step&lt;/appstep&gt;</pre>

</div>
<div class="fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 2. Example domain element with class attribute</span>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;wintitle class="+ topic/keyword ui-d/wintitle "&gt;A specialized keyword&lt;/wintitle&gt;</pre>

</div>
</div>

<p>When the class attribute is declared in the DTD or schema, it must be declared
with a default value. In order to support generalization round-tripping (generalizing
specialized content into a generic form and then returning it to the specialized
form) the default value must not be fixed. This allows the generalization
process to overwrite the default values in a general document type with specialized
values taken from the document being generalized.</p>

<div class="p">When a specialized type declares new elements, it must provide a class
 attribute for the new element. The class attribute must include a mapping
 for every structural type or domain in the specialized type's ancestry, even
those in  which no element renaming occurred. The mapping should start with
the value for the base type (for example topic or map),  and finish with the
current element type. <div class="fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 3. Example attribute with intermediate value</span>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;windowname class="- topic/kwd task/<strong>kwd</strong> guitask/windowname "&gt;</pre>

</div>
Intermediate values are necessary so that generalizing and specializing
transforms can map  values simply and accurately. For example, if task/kwd
was missing as a  value, and a user decided to generalize this guitask up
to a task topic, then the  transform would have to guess whether to map to
kwd (appropriate if task  is more general than guitask, which it is) or leave
as windowname (appropriate if task  were more specialized, which it isn't).
By always providing mappings for  more general values, we can then apply the
simple rule that missing  mappings must by default be to more specialized
values than the one we are generalizing to, which means the  last value in
the list is appropriate. For example, when specializing to &lt;task&gt;, if a &lt;p&gt;
element has no target value for &lt;task&gt;, we can safely assume that &lt;p&gt;
does not specialize from &lt;task&gt; and should not be generalized.</div>

<p>While this example is trivial, more  complicated hierarchies (say, five
levels deep, with renaming occurring at  two and four only) make explicit
intermediate values essential.</p>

<p>A specialized type does not need to change the class attribute for  elements
that it does not specialize, but simply reuses by reference from  more generic
levels. For example, since task, bctask, and guitask use the  p element without
specializing it, they don't need to declare mappings for  it. </p>

<p>A specialized type only declares class attributes for the elements that
it  uniquely declares. It does not need to declare class attributes for  elements
that it reuses or inherits.</p>
