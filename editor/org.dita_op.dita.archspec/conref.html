<h1 class="topictitle1">Content inclusion (conref)</h1>


<div><p>The DITA conref attribute provides a mechanism for reuse of content
fragments. The conref attribute stores a reference to another element and
is processed to replace the referencing element with the referenced element. </p>

<p>The element containing the content reference acts as a placeholder for
the referenced element. The identifier for the referenced element must be
either absolute or resolvable in the context of the referencing element. (See <a href="id.html" title="The DITA identity attribute provides mechanisms for identifying content for retrieval or linking. The syntax for referencing IDs is consistent regardless of the referencing mechanism.">IDs and references</a> for the details on identifiers.)</p>

<p>More formally, the DITA conref attribute can be considered a transclusion
mechanism. In that respect, conref is similar to XInclude as well as HyTime
value references. DITA differs from these mechanisms, however, by comparing
the constraints of each context to ensure the ongoing validity of the replacement
content in its new context. In other words, conref validity does not apply
simply to the current content at the time of replacement, but to the ranges
of possible content given the constraints of the two document types. A valid
conref processor does not allow the resolution of a reuse relationship that
could be rendered invalid under the rules of either the reused or reusing
content.</p>

<p> If the referenced element is the same type as the referencing element
and the list of domains in the referenced topic instance (declared on the
domains attribute) is the same as or a subset of the list of domains in the
referencing document, the element set allowed in the referenced element is
guaranteed to be the same as, or a subset of, the element set allowed in the
placeholder element. In the preferred approach, a processor resolving a conref
should tolerate specializations of valid elements and generalize elements
in the content fragment as needed for the referencing context.</p>

<p>Replacement of the placeholder occurs after parsing of the document but
prior to any styling or other transformational or presentational operations
on the full topic.</p>

<p>The target of the conref may be substituted based on build-time or runtime
conditions. For example, content such as product names or install paths can
be separated out from topic content since they change when the topic is reused
by other products; the reusing product can substitute their own targets for
the conref to allow resolution to their own product name and install paths,
and so on.</p>

<p>The target of a conref must be within a DITA topic or DITA map (or point
to the entire topic or map). Fragments of DITA content (such as a document
containing only a single paragraph) do not contain enough information on their
own to allow the conref processor to determine the validity of a reference
to them.</p>

<div class="p">The
resolved element's attribute specifications can be drawn from both source
and target elements in the following priority:<br /><ol>
<li>All attributes as specified on the source element except for attributes
which specify the value "-dita-use-conref-target"</li>

<li>All attributes as specified on the target element except:<br /><ol type="a">
<li>The id attribute</li>

<li>Any attribute also specified on the source element such that its specified
value (on the source element) is not "-dita-use-conref-target"</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li>The xml:lang attribute has special treatment as described in <a href="xmllang.html" title="Specifies the language (and optionally the locale) of the element content. The intent declared with xml:lang is considered to apply to all attributes and content of the element where it is specified, unless overridden with an instance of xml:lang on another element within that content. When no xml:lang value is supplied, the processor should assume a default value.">The xml:lang attribute</a>.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<p>The only time the resolved element would include an attribute whose specified
value is "-dita-use-conref-target" is when  the  target element had that attribute
specified with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value  and the source element
either had no specification for  that attribute or had it specified with the
"-dita-use-conref-target" value. If the final resolved element (after the
complete resolution of any  conref chain) has an attribute with the "-dita-use-conref-target"
value, that should be treated as equivalent to having that attribute  unspecified.</p>

<p>A given attribute value on the resolved element comes in its entirety from
either the source or target: the attribute values of the  target and source
for a given attribute are never additive, even if the property (such as the
audience type) takes a list of values.</p>

<p>If the target element has a conref attribute specified, the above rules
should be applied recursively with the resolved element from one  source/target
combination becoming  one of the two  elements participating in  the next
source/target combination. The result should preserve without generalization
all elements that are valid in the originating context, even if they are not
valid in an intermediate context. For example, if topicA and topicC allow
highlighting, and topicB does not, then a content reference chain of topicA-&gt;topicB-&gt;topicC
should preserve any highlighting elements in the referenced content. The result
is the same as if the conref pairs are resolved recursively starting from
the source element. </p>
