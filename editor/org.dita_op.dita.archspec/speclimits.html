<h1 class="topictitle1">Limits of specialization</h1>


<div><p>There are times when a new structural or domain type appears not
to fit into the existing hierarchy, based on the semantics of the existing
types and the restrictions of the specialization process. In these cases there
are a variety of options to consider.</p>

<p>The basic specialization mechanism used by the DITA document types can
 also be used for non-DITA document types in order to provide the  same re-use,
specialization, and interoperation benefits that one can  get from the DITA
document types, but restricted to the specific domain within which the new
document types apply. Note that even if one uses the DITA-defined types as
a  starting point, any change to those base types not accomplished through
specialization defines a completely new document  type that has no meaningful
or normative relationship to the DITA document types and cannot be considered
in any way to be a conforming  DITA application. In other words, the use of
DITA specialization from non-DITA base types does not produce DITA-compliant
document types.</p>

<p>However, given the substantial benefits of building from the common DITA
base classes (including the ability to generalize to a common format, use
of standards-compliant tools and processes, and reuse of content across document
types through DITA maps and conref) there are some techniques to consider
before complete departure from the DITA content architecture.</p>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Specialize from generic elements or attributes</h2>


<div><p>The first option to consider is to choose more generic base elements
or attributes from the available set. There are generic elements in DITA available
at every level of detail, from whole generic topics down to individual generic
keywords, and the generic attribute base is available for attribute domain
specialization.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to create a new kind of list but cannot usefully
do so specializing from &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;sl&gt;, or &lt;dl&gt;, you can create
a new set of list elements by specializing nested &lt;ph&gt; elements. This new
list structure will not be semantically tied to the other lists by ancestry,
and so will require specialized processing to receive appropriate output styling.
However, it will remain a valid DITA specialization, with the standard support
for generalization, content referencing, conditional processing, and so forth.</p>

<div class="p">The following base elements in &lt;topic&gt; are generic enough to support
almost any structurally valid specialization:<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">topic</dt>

<dd>any content unit that has a title and associated content</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">section</dt>

<dd>any non-nesting division of content within a topic, titled or not</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">p</dt>

<dd>any non-titled block of content below the section level</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">fig</dt>

<dd>any titled block of content below the section level</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">ul, ol, dl, sl, simpletable</dt>

<dd>any structured block of content that consists of listed items in one or
more columns</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">ph</dt>

<dd>any division of content below the paragraph level</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">keyword</dt>

<dd>any non-nesting division of content below the paragraph level</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">data</dt>

<dd>any content designed for internal processing rather than human-readable
output</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">foreign</dt>

<dd>any content that already has a non-DITA markup standard but needs to be
authored as part of the DITA document </dd>


<dt class="dlterm">unknown</dt>

<dd>any non-standard markup that does not fit the DITA model but needs to
be managed as part of a DITA document</dd>

</dl>
The following attributes in topic are suitable for domain specialization
to provide new attributes that are required throughout a document type:<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">props</dt>

<dd>any new conditional processing attribute</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">base</dt>

<dd>any new attribute that is universally available, has a simple syntax (space-delimited
alphanumeric values), and doesn't already have a semantic equivalent</dd>

</dl>
You should specialize from the semantically closest match whenever
possible. When some structural requirement forces you to pick a more general
ancestor, please inform the technical committee: over time a richer set of
generic elements should become available.</div>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="customsubset"><a name="customsubset"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Customized subset document types for authoring</h2>


<div><p>DITA markup is organized into domain and structural
type modules so that authoring groups can easily select the markup subset
they require by creating a new document type shell. However, when an authoring
group requires a subset of markup rules that does not follow the boundaries
of the type modules (for example, global removal of certain attributes or
elements), you can if necessary create a customized document type for the
sake of enforcing these rules at authoring time, as long as the document types
are validated using a standards-compliant document type at processing time.</p>

<p>A customized subset document type should be created without editing of
the type modules. The document type shell can override entities in the module
files, including attributes and content models, by providing a new definition
of the entity before importing the module files.</p>

<p>Customized subset document types are not conformant with the DITA  standard,
and may not be supported by standards-conformant tools. For example, if you
customize document types to remove the &lt;xref&gt; element,  you may not be
able to use off-the-shelf DITA editors to create your content.</p>

</div>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="mapfromcustom"><a name="mapfromcustom"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Map from customized document type to DITA during preprocessing</h2>


<div><p>While specialization can be used to adapt document types for many
 different authoring purposes, there are some authoring requirements that
 cannot be met through specialization, in particular, splitting or  renaming
attributes, or renaming elements through specialization without also specializing
their containers.</p>

<p> In cases where structural
and domain specialization of elements or attributes is not sufficient, and
where the new document type can be straightforwardly and reliably transformed
to a standard document type, the authoring group may be best served by a customized
document type that is transformed to a standard document type as part of the
publishing pipeline. For example, if an authoring group requires the &lt;p&gt;
element to be spelled out as &lt;paragraph&gt;, the document type could be customized
to change &lt;p&gt; to &lt;paragraph&gt; and then preprocessed to rename &lt;paragraph&gt;
back to &lt;p&gt; before feeding the documents into a standard publishing process.</p>

<p>A customized document type should be created without editing of the type
modules. The document type shell can override entities in the module files,
including attributes and content models, by providing a new definition of
the entity before importing the type module files.</p>

<p>Customized document types are not compliant with the DITA standard, and
will not be supported by standards-compliant tools. Preprocessing can ensure
compatibility with existing publishing processes, but does not ensure compatibility
with DITA-supporting authoring tools or content management systems. However,
when an implementation is being heavily customized in any case, a customized
document types can help isolate and control the implications of non-standard
design in a customized implementation.</p>
