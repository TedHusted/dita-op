<h1 class="topictitle1">Specialization of attributes</h1>


<div><p>When creating a structural specialization, you can limit the contents
of existing attributes on your new elements; you can also create new attributes
through domain specialization based off of the props attribute (for conditional
processing) or the base attribute (for other simple token attributes).</p>

<p>Domain attribute specialization allows DITA document type developers to
incorporate new conditional processing attributes that can be used for filtering
and flagging, or new attributes with no existing equivalent that can be managed
and generalized in the same way as conditional processing attributes. </p>

<div class="p">The new attributes need to be based off of either props or base:<br /><ul>
<li>Attributes specialized from props are identified as conditional processing
attributes</li>

<li>Attributes specialized from base have no existing behavior associated
with them</li>

<li>Values in specialized attributes should be preserved during generalization
and respecialization</li>

<li>While generalized, the attribute values should still be understandable
by both general and specialized behaviors, and be treated as equivalent to
their specialized form. For example, conditional filtering should
work the same way on specialized attributes and on generalized attributes.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Because there is a strong possibility that the existing conditional processing
attributes (audience, platform, product, and otherprops) will be moved into
a domain based off of props in the future, structural specializations are
discouraged from limiting the values in those attributes.</p>
