<div><p>A &lt;<span class="keyword">required-cleanup</span>&gt; element is used as
a placeholder for migrated elements that cannot be appropriately tagged without
manual intervention. As the element name implies, the intent for authors is
to clean up the contained material and eventually get rid of the &lt;<span class="keyword">required-cleanup</span>&gt;
element. Authors should not insert this element into documents. </p>

<div class="section"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Because the content of &lt;<span class="keyword">required-cleanup</span>&gt;
is not considered to be verified data, <strong>DITA processors are required to
strip this element from output by default.</strong> A runtime flag <em><span class="keyword">may</span></em> be
provided to allow a draft view of migrated content in context.</div>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2><p>Presuming an original HTML document had
contained some content within a &lt;<span class="keyword">center</span>&gt; tag (for
which there is no clear migrational equivalent in DITA), the following might
be the result that is valid within an XML editor, but which requires an author
to decide how to better tag or revise this original content:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Some section title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;required-cleanup remap="center"&gt;Some original content migrated
