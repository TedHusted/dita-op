<h1 class="topictitle1">simpletable</h1>



<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">simpletable</span>&gt; element is used for
tables that are regular in structure and do not need a caption. Choose the
simple table element when you want to show information in regular rows and
columns. For example, multi-column tabular data such as phone directory listings
or parts lists are good candidates for simpletable. Another good use of simpletable
is for information that seems to beg for a "three-part definition list"—just
use the keycol attribute to indicate which column represents the "key" or
term-like column of your structure. </p>

<div class="section"><p>This close match of simpletable to tabular, regular data makes
simpletable suitable as the basis for specialized structures such as <a href="properties.html" title="The &lt;properties&gt; element gives a list of properties for the subject of the current topic, for example whether a class is public or protected. Each property can include the type, value, and a description. The typical rendering is usually in a table-like format. To represent multiple values for a type, just create additional property elements and use only the &lt;propvalue&gt; element (and &lt;propdesc&gt; when needed) for each successive value.">properties</a> (for programming information) and <a href="choicetable.html" title="The &lt;choicetable&gt; element contains a series of optional choices available within a step of a task.">choice tables</a> (for tasks).</p>
