<h1 class="topictitle1">reference</h1>



<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">reference</span>&gt; element defines a top-level
container for a reference topic. Reference topics document programming constructs
or facts about a product. Examples of reference topics include language elements,
class descriptions, commands, functions, statements, protocols, types, declarators,
operands, and API information, which provide quick access to facts, but no
explanation of concepts or procedures. Reference topics have the same high-level
structure as any other topic type, with a title, short description, and body.
Within the body, reference topics are typically organized into one or more
sections, property lists, and tables. The reference topic type provides general
rules that apply to all kinds of reference information, using elements like &lt;<span class="keyword">refsyn</span>&gt;
for syntax or signatures, and &lt;<span class="keyword">properties</span>&gt; for lists
of properties and values.</p>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2><pre class="codeblock">&lt;reference id="refexample"&gt;

  using &amp;lt;synph&gt; or &amp;lt;syntax&gt; markup for explicit
