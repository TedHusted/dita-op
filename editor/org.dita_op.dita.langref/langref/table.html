<h1 class="topictitle1">table</h1>



<div><div><span>The &lt;<span class="keyword">table</span>&gt; element organizes
arbitrarily complex relationships of tabular information. This standard table
markup allows column or row spanning and table captions or descriptions. An
optional title allowed inside the table element provides a caption to describe
the table.</span>
 See <span><a href="simpletable.html" title="The &lt;simpletable&gt; element is used for tables that are regular in structure and do not need a caption. Choose the simple table element when you want to show information in regular rows and columns. For example, multi-column tabular data such as phone directory listings or parts lists are good candidates for simpletable. Another good use of simpletable is for information that seems to beg for a &quot;three-part definition list&quot;â€”just use the keycol attribute to indicate which column represents the &quot;key&quot; or term-like column of your structure.">simpletable</a></span> for
a simplified table model that can be specialized to represent more regular
relationships of data.</div>

<div class="section"><p>The DITA table is based on the OASIS Exchange Table Model, augmented
with DITA attributes which enable it for specialization, conref, and other
DITA processing.  In addition, the table includes a <span class="apiname">desc</span> element,
which enables table description that is parallel with figure description.</p>
<p>In DITA tables, in place of the expanse attribute used by other DITA elements, the pgwide attribute is
used in order to conform with the OASIS Exchange Table Model. This attribute has a similar semantic
(1=page width; 0=resize to galley or column).</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The
scale attribute represents a stylistic markup property that is maintained
for now in tables for legacy purposes.  External stylesheets should enable
less dependency on this attribute. You should use the scale attribute judiciously
in your topics.</div>
