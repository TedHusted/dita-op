<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">topic</span>&gt; element is the top-level DITA
element for a single-subject topic or article. Other top-level DITA elements
that are more content-specific are &lt;<span class="keyword">concept</span>&gt;, &lt;<span class="keyword">task</span>&gt;, &lt;<span class="keyword">reference</span>&gt;,
and &lt;<span class="keyword">glossary</span>&gt;.</p>

<div class="section">       <div class="p">To support applications that are namespace-aware, DITA
DTDs and Schemas provide the following namespaced declarations for topic,
and for topic-level elements derived from topic: <pre class="pre">
ditaarch:DITAArchVersion="1.0" 
xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"

 In DTDs, the <span class="q">"ditaarch"</span> prefix is parameterized to enable future
specialization.</div>
