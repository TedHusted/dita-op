the HTML &lt;<span class="keyword">object</span>&gt; element.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">object</span>&gt; element allows authors to
include animated images, applets, plug-ins, ActiveX controls, video clips,
and other multimedia objects in a topic for rendering after transformation
to HTML.</p>
<p>To support Flash animations and movies, the value <span class="filepath">swflash.cab</span> is
checked in the codebase attribute. That enables the OBJECT tag in the HTML
to display Flash objects in Intenet Explorer. The enable these to display
in browsers such as NetScape and FireFox, an EMBED tag is also added to the
HTML. Note that while the Embed tag is required to display these objects,
the Embed tag is not in the XHTML 1.0 Transitional tag set.</p>
