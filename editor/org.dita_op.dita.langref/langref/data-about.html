<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">data-about</span>&gt; element identifies the
subject of a property when the subject isn't associated with the context in

element. The &lt;<span class="keyword">data-about</span>&gt; element handles exception
cases where a property must be expressed somewhere other than inside the actual
