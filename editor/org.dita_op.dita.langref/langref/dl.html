<div><p>A definition list (&lt;<span class="keyword">dl</span>&gt;) is a list of
terms and corresponding definitions. The term (&lt;<span class="keyword">dt</span>&gt;)
is usually flush left. The description or definition (&lt;<span class="keyword">dd</span>&gt;)
is usually either indented and on the next line, or on the same line to the
right of the term.</p>

<div class="section">       <p>You can also provide an optional heading for the terms
and definitions, using the &lt;<span class="keyword">dlhead</span>&gt; element, which
contains header elements for those columns. The default formatting for the &lt;<span class="keyword">dlhead</span>&gt;
looks like a table with a heading row.</p>
