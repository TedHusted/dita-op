Sections are used to organize subsets of information that are directly related to the topic. For example, the titles Reference Syntax, Example and Properties might represent section-level discourse within a topic about a command-line process—the content in each section relates uniquely to the subject of that topic. Multiple sections within a single topic do not represent a hierarchy, but rather peer divisions of that topic. Sections cannot be nested. A section may have an optional title.">section</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/example.html" title="The &lt;example&gt; element is a section with the specific role of containing examples that illustrate or support the current topic.

Default processing treats the property values as an unknown kind of metadata, but custom processing can match the name attribute or specialized element to format properties as sidebars or other adornments or to harvest properties for automated processing.">data</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/title.html" title="The &lt;title&gt; element contains a heading or label for the main parts of a topic, including the topic as a whole, its sections and examples, and its labelled content, such as figures and tables.
