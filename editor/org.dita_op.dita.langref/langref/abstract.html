<h1 class="topictitle1">abstract</h1>



<div><p>The abstract element occurs between the topic title and the topic
body, as the initial content of a topic. It can contain paragraph-level content
as well as one or more shortdesc elements which can be used for providing
link previews or summaries. The &lt;abstract&gt; element cannot be overridden
by maps, but its contained &lt;shortdesc&gt; elements can be, for the purpose
of creating link summaries or previews.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Use the &lt;abstract&gt; element when the initial paragraph of a
topic is unsuitable for use as a link preview or for summaries, for example
because it contains lists or tables, or because only a portion of the paragraph
is suitable. Note that when the initial paragraph is suitable as a summary,
that content should be placed in a &lt;shortdesc&gt; element rather than in an
&lt;abstract&gt; element. The &lt;abstract&gt; element allows for a wider range
of content in your initial paragraph, such as lists and tables, and allows
you to identify portions of the &lt;abstract&gt; content as useful for previews
or summaries by embedding the &lt;shortdesc&gt; element within &lt;abstract&gt;.</p>
<p>When
the contained &lt;shortdesc&gt; occurs within phrase-level content, it is treated
as phrase-level content and should not create a separate paragraph on output
of the topic. When the contained &lt;shortdesc&gt; occurs as a peer to paragraph-level
content, it is treated as block-level content and should create a separate
paragraph on output of the topic. When multiple &lt;shortdesc&gt; elements are
included in an &lt;abstract&gt;, they are concatenated in output of link previews
or summaries (separated by spaces).</p>

Tasks are the main building blocks for task-oriented user assistance. They generally provide step-by-step instructions that will enable a user to perform a task. A task answers the question of &quot;how to?&quot; by telling the user precisely what to do and the order in which to do it. Tasks have the same high-level structure as other topics, with a title, short description and body.">task</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/reference.html" title="The &lt;reference&gt; element defines a top-level container for a reference topic. Reference topics document programming constructs or facts about a product. Examples of reference topics include language elements, class descriptions, commands, functions, statements, protocols, types, declarators, operands, and API information, which provide quick access to facts, but no explanation of concepts or procedures. Reference topics have the same high-level structure as any other topic type, with a title, short description, and body. Within the body, reference topics are typically organized into one or more sections, property lists, and tables. The reference topic type provides general rules that apply to all kinds of reference information, using elements like &lt;refsyn&gt; for syntax or signatures, and &lt;properties&gt; for lists of properties and values.">reference</a></td>
