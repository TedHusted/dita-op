<div><p>Use footnote (&lt;<span class="keyword">fn</span>&gt;) to annotate text with
notes that are not appropriate for inclusion in line or to indicate the source
for facts or other material used in the text. </p>

<div class="section">Footnote content is always skipped at the place where it was entered,
and reproduced elsewhere, according to these rules: <br /><ul>
<li>A footnote with no given <em><span class="keyword">id</span></em> attribute is a <strong>single-use</strong> footnote.
Upon output, it generates a number as a superscript <span class="q">"callout"</span> that is
linked to the placement of the footnote, usually at the bottom of the immediate
printed page or at the end of the Web article. Subsequent footnotes in the
same topic will have the next number in sequence for their callouts. If you
enter a particular character in the <em><span class="keyword">callout</span></em> attribute
for the footnote, that character will be used as the superscript <span class="q">"callout"</span> that
is linked to the placement of the footnote.                              
        </li>

<li>A footnote entered with an <em><span class="keyword">id</span></em> attribute is a <strong>use-by-reference</strong> footnote.
Upon output, it does not appear anywhere unless it has been referenced using
an &lt;<span class="keyword">xref</span>&gt; with the <em><span class="keyword">type</span></em> attribute
set to <span class="q">"fn"</span>. The same callout behaviors will apply.</li>

<li>Ordinarily, a footnote in one topic can't be referenced in another topic.
The previous behaviors are local to each topic. But by using the &lt;<span class="keyword">conref</span>&gt;
mechanism, you can instance another topic's footnote into the local topic
where it will then follow those behaviors:<br /><ul>
<li>If you use <samp class="codeph">&lt;fn conref="thatid"&gt;&lt;/fn&gt;</samp> all
by itself, the result will be the same as the single-use footnote entered
literally in the same location.</li>

<li>If you use <samp class="codeph">&lt;fn conref="thatid" id="thisid"&gt;&lt;/fn&gt;</samp>,
then <samp class="codeph">&lt;xref href="thisid" type="fn"/&gt;</samp>, the result will
be the same as the use-by-reference model described before.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2><div class="p">The first example uses a simple
fn element, with no ID and no callout attribute. In that case, markup such
as the following:<pre class="codeblock">The memory storage capacity of the computer is 
2 GB&lt;fn&gt;A GB (gigabyte) is equal to 
1000 million bytes&lt;/fn&gt; with error correcting support.</pre>
may produce
output similar to the following:<blockquote><p>The memory storage capacity of the
computer is 2 GB<sup>1</sup> with error correcting support.</p>
<p><samp class="codeph">......</samp></p>
<p><sup>1</sup> A
GB (gigabyte) is equal to  1000 million bytes</p>
<p>----- [bottom of page] -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">The second example uses a callout attribute. It is marked up as follows:<pre class="codeblock">The memory storage capacity of the computer is 
2 GB&lt;fn callout="#"&gt;A GB (gigabyte) is equal to 
1000 million bytes&lt;/fn&gt; with error correcting support.</pre>
That
DITA markup may produce output similar to the following:<blockquote><p>The memory
storage capacity of the computer is 2 GB<sup>#</sup> with error correcting
support.</p>
<p><samp class="codeph">......</samp></p>
<p><sup>#</sup> A GB (gigabyte)
is equal to  1000 million bytes</p>
<p>----- [bottom of page] -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="p">The
third example uses an ID on a footnote, and then references that ID multiple
times. The DITA markup looks like this:<pre class="codeblock">I like pets. &lt;fn id="reuse-fn"&gt;This is the name of an animal.&lt;/fn&gt;
At my house, I have a dog&lt;xref href="#topic/reuse-fn"/&gt;, a
cat&lt;xref href="#topic/reuse-fn"/&gt;, and a llama&lt;xref href="topic/reuse-fn"/&gt;.</pre>
and
may produce output similar to the following:<blockquote><p>I like pets. At my house,
I have a dog<sup>1</sup>, a cat<sup>1</sup>, and a llama<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><samp class="codeph">......</samp></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>This
is the name of an animal.</p>
<p>----- [bottom of page] -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Footnote
support may vary between different output types, depending on conventions
and capabilities. For example, PDF output may lack support for the <em>callout</em> attribute,
or footnotes may be collected as endnotes for certain types of Web publications.</div>

As a container element, it can be used to sub-divide or organize elements that occur inside a list item, definition, or parameter definition.">itemgroup</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/dd.html" title="The definition description (&lt;dd&gt;) element contains the description of a term in a definition list entry.">dd</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/fig.html" title="The figure (&lt;fig&gt;) element is a display context (sometimes called an exhibit) with an optional title for a wide variety of content. Most commonly, the figure element contains an image element (a graphic or artwork), but it can contain several kinds of text objects as well. A title is placed inside the figure element to provide a caption to describe the content.">fig</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/figgroup.html" title="The &lt;figgroup&gt; element is used only for specialization at this time. Figure groups can be used to contain multiple cross-references, footnotes or keywords, but not multipart images. Multipart images in DITA should be represented by a suitable media type displayed by the &lt;object&gt; element.">figgroup</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/pre.html" title="The preformatted element (&lt;pre&gt;) preserves line breaks and spaces entered manually by the author in the content of the element, and also presents the content in a monospaced type font (depending on your output formatting processor). Do not use &lt;pre&gt; when a more semantically specific element is appropriate, such as &lt;codeblock&gt;.">pre</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/lines.html" title="The &lt;lines&gt; element may be used to represent dialogs, lists, text fragments, and so forth. The &lt;lines&gt; element is similar to &lt;pre&gt; in that hard line breaks are preserved, but the font style is not set to monospace, and extra spaces inside the lines are not preserved.">lines</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/ph.html" title="The phrase (&lt;ph&gt;) element is used to organize content for reuse or conditional processing (for example, when part of a paragraph applies to a particular audience). It can be used by specializations of DITA to create semantic markup for content at the phrase level, which then allows (but does not require) specific processing or formatting.">ph</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/stentry.html" title="The simpletable entry (&lt;stentry&gt;) element represents a single table cell, like &lt;entry&gt; in &lt;table&gt;. You can place any number of stentry cells in either an &lt;sthead&gt; element (for headings) or &lt;strow&gt; element (for rows of data).">stentry</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/entry.html" title="The &lt;entry&gt; element defines a single cell in a table.">entry</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/abstract.html" title="The abstract element occurs between the topic title and the topic body, as the initial content of a topic. It can contain paragraph-level content as well as one or more shortdesc elements which can be used for providing link previews or summaries. The &lt;abstract&gt; element cannot be overridden by maps, but its contained &lt;shortdesc&gt; elements can be, for the purpose of creating link summaries or previews.">abstract</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/section.html" title="The &lt;section&gt; element represents an organizational division in a topic. Sections are used to organize subsets of information that are directly related to the topic. For example, the titles Reference Syntax, Example and Properties might represent section-level discourse within a topic about a command-line process—the content in each section relates uniquely to the subject of that topic. Multiple sections within a single topic do not represent a hierarchy, but rather peer divisions of that topic. Sections cannot be nested. A section may have an optional title.">section</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/example.html" title="The &lt;example&gt; element is a section with the specific role of containing examples that illustrate or support the current topic. The &lt;example&gt; element has the same content model as &lt;section&gt;.">example</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/glossdef.html" title="The &lt;glossdef&gt; element specifies the definition of one sense of a term. If a term has multiple senses, create a separate &lt;glossentry&gt; topic to define each sense.">glossdef</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/screen.html" title="The &lt;screen&gt; element contains or refers to a textual representation of a computer screen or user interface panel (window).">screen</a>, <a href="../common/../langref/codeblock.html" title="The &lt;codeblock&gt; element represents lines of program code. Like the &lt;pre&gt; element, content of this element has preserved line endings and is output in a monospaced font.
