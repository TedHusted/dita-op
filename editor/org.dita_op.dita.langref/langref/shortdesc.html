<h1 class="topictitle1">shortdesc</h1>



<div><p>The short description (&lt;<span class="keyword">shortdesc</span>&gt;) element
occurs between the topic title and the topic body, as the initial paragraph-like
content of a topic, or it can be embedded in an abstract element. The short
description, which represents the purpose or theme of the topic, is also intended
to be used as a link preview and for searching. When used within a DITA map,
the short description of the &lt;topicref&gt; can be used to override the short
description in the topic.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Use the &lt;shortdesc&gt; element when the first paragraph of topic
content is simple enough to be suitable for use as a link preview or for summaries.
Otherwise use the &lt;abstract&gt; element instead to provide richer content
around the &lt;shortdesc&gt;. See the <a href="abstract.html" title="The abstract element occurs between the topic title and the topic body, as the initial content of a topic. It can contain paragraph-level content as well as one or more shortdesc elements which can be used for providing link previews or summaries. The &lt;abstract&gt; element cannot be overridden by maps, but its contained &lt;shortdesc&gt; elements can be, for the purpose of creating link summaries or previews.">abstract</a> description
for more details on the behavior of shortdesc in an abstract.</p>
<p>While
inclusion of the &lt;shortdesc&gt; element is not mandated by DITA or the
tools, it is recommended that topics contain this element. In cases where
a topic contains only one paragraph, then it is preferable to include this
text in the &lt;shortdesc&gt; and leave the topic body empty. </p>
 <p>The short description should
be a single, concise paragraph containing one or two sentences of no more
than 50 words.</p>
