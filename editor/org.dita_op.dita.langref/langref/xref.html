<h1 class="topictitle1">xref</h1>



<div><p>Use the cross-reference (&lt;<span class="keyword">xref</span>&gt;) element
to link to a different location within the current topic, or a different topic
within the same help system, or to external sources, such as Web pages, or
to a location in another topic. The <em><span class="keyword">href</span></em> attribute
on the &lt;<span class="keyword">xref</span>&gt; element provides the location of the
target.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Typically it is best to restrict yourself to linking to reference
topics where the content of the target is clear from the &lt;<span class="keyword">xref</span>&gt;'s
text, for example API names and their descriptions. With other information
types, it may be less clear to the user whether they should follow the link,
and often they will, thereby missing important information in following paragraphs.
Therefore it is a good idea to use links at the end of the topic, in the &lt;<a href="related-links.html" title="The related information links of a topic (&lt;related-links&gt; element) are stored in a special section following the body of the topic. After a topic is processed into it final output form, the related links are usually displayed at the end of the topic, although some Web-based help systems might display them in a separate navigation frame.">related-links</a>&gt; element, wherever possible,
rather than linking from within body content using &lt;<span class="keyword">xref</span>&gt;.
Links at the end of a topic can also be managed from outside the topic, using
DITA maps: this allows topics to be quickly integrated into new contexts without
breaking links.</p>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Examples</h2><p>Here's an example of a cross-reference
to another topic; that topic's title will be used as the link text.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;p&gt;Background information about DITA is provided in the topic titled
&lt;xref href="whatsdita.dita#tmmdita"&gt;&lt;/xref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>Here's
an example of a cross-reference to another topic; the supplied text will be
used as the link text</p>
<pre class="codeblock">&lt;p&gt;&lt;xref href="whatsdita.dita#tmmdita"&gt;Background information about DITA&lt;/xref&gt; is provided
free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<div class="p">If you are linking to anything within
a topic, you should use the following format in the href attribute: <pre class="codeblock">filename.xml#topicid/elementid</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">If
you are linking within the same file, you can leave off the "filename.xml"
part. So, for a section with the ID "mysection", you should use: <pre class="codeblock">#topicid/mysection  </pre>
</div>
<div class="p">For
a list item within that section, assuming the item has an ID of "mylist",
use <pre class="codeblock">#topicid/mylist  </pre>
</div>
<p>Regardless of how deeply
the target element is nested, the only important pieces are the ID of the
containing topic, and the ID of the target element. IDs of topics in DITA
must be unique within a file, but IDs of other elements only need to be unique
within the topic. You need to be sure that the topic ID is part of your reference.</p>
<div class="p">If
your URL has an ampersand in it, you need to code that using a symbol. For
example; for this URL:<pre class="codeblock">http://www.ibm.com/docview.wss?rs=757&amp;context=SSVNX5
</pre>
You need to enter the &amp;amp; in the Href attribute as follows:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;xref href="http://www.ibm.com/docview.wss?rs=757<strong>&amp;amp;</strong>context=SSVNX5"&gt;
Part number SSVNX5&lt;/xref&gt;</pre>

<td valign="top" headers="N11D1E">href</td>

<td valign="top" headers="N11D24">A hyperlink to an external Web page (URL) or other non-DITA resource,
to another DITA topic in the same file or in another file, or to a specific
element inside a DITA topic. The format attribute identifies the format of
the target. Non-DITA targets use standard URL syntax. DITA content is targetted
as follows:<pre class="pre">Target elsewhere in the same file:
  href="#topicID"
  href="#topicID/elemID
Target in a different file:
  href="filename.dita#topicID"
  href="fname.dita#topicID/elemID"</pre>
Elements inside a topic
need to have their location scoped by the containing topic's ID. Only
the id of the target element and the topic that contains it matter: id's
on any other containing elements (for example an id on the &lt;<span class="keyword">body</span>&gt;
element) are not part of the link syntax.<p>If the URL contains an ampersand
character, the ampersand symbol (&amp;amp;) should be used to indicate that
character</p>
