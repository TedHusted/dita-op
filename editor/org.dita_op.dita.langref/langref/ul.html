<div><p>In an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;), the order of the list items
is not significant. List items are typically styled on output with a "bullet"
character, depending on nesting level.</p>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2><pre class="codeblock">&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;This is an item in an unordered list.&lt;/li&gt;

 formatter puts a bullet beside it.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The following paragraph, contained in the list item
 element, is part of the list item which contains it.
 &lt;p&gt;This is the contained paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
