<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">section</span>&gt; element represents an organizational
division in a topic. Sections are used to organize subsets of information
that are directly related to the topic. For example, the titles <strong>Reference
Syntax</strong>, <strong>Example</strong> and <strong>Properties</strong> might represent section-level
discourse within a topic about a command-line process—the content in each
section relates uniquely to the subject of that topic. Multiple sections within
a single topic do not represent a hierarchy, but rather peer divisions of
that topic. Sections cannot be nested. A section may have an optional title.</p>
