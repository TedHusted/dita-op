<div><p>Include artwork or images in a DITA topic by using the &lt;<span class="keyword">image</span>&gt;
element. The &lt;<span class="keyword">image</span>&gt; element has optional attributes
that indicate  whether the placement of the included graphic or artwork  should
be inline (like a button or icon) or on a separate  line for a larger image.
 There are also optional attributes  that indicate the size to which the included
graphic or artwork  should be scaled. An <span class="keyword">href</span> attribute
is required on the image element, as this attribute creates a pointer to the
image, and allows the output formatting processor to bring the image into
the text flow. To make the intent of the image more accessible for users using
screen readers or text-only readers, always include a description of the image's
content in the <span class="keyword">alt </span> element.</p>
