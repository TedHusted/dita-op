<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt; element identifies a topic
(such as a concept, task, or reference) or other resource. A &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt;
can contain other&lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt; elements, allowing you
to express navigation or table-of-contents hierarchies, as well as implying
relationships between the containing &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt; and
its children. You can set the collection-type of a container &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt;
to determine how its children are related to each other. You can also express
relationships among &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt;s using group and table
structures (using &lt;<span class="keyword">topicgroup</span>&gt; and &lt;<span class="keyword">reltable</span>&gt;).
Relationships end up expressed as links in the output (with each participant
in a relationship having links to the other participants by default). </p>

<div class="section"><p>You can fine tune the output from your map by setting different
attributes on topicrefs: for example, the <em><span class="keyword">linking</span></em> attribute
controls how its relationships to other topicrefs are expressed as links,
and the <em><span class="keyword">toc</span></em> attribute controls whether the topicref
shows up in TOC or navigation output.</p>
</div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2>In this example, there are six topicrefs. They
are nested and have a hierarchical relationship. Bats.dita is the parent topic
and the other topics are its children.<pre class="codeblock">&lt;map title="Bats"&gt;
