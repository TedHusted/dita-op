<div><p>The syntax diagram (&lt;<span class="keyword">syntaxdiagram</span>&gt;) element
is the main container for all the syntax elements that make up a syntax definition.
The syntax diagram represents the syntax of a statement from a computer language,
or a command, function call or programming language statement. Traditionally,
the syntax diagram is formatted with <span class="q">"railroad tracks"</span> that connect the
units of the syntax together, but this presentation may differ depending on
the output media. The syntax diagram element is part of the DITA programming
domain, a special set of DITA elements designed to document programming tasks,
concepts and reference information.</p>
