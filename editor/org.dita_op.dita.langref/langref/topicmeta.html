<div><p>The &lt;<span class="keyword">topicmeta</span>&gt; element defines the metadata
that applies to a topic when it appears in a map, and to the other topics
in the map that are contained by the same element that contains the &lt;topicmeta&gt;
element. When creating links, it can also be used to override the title and
short description of the topic. In addition, it can be used to add index entries
to referenced content using the &lt;<span class="keyword">keywords</span>&gt; element.</p>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2>In this example, the metadata defined by the
topicmeta element applies to the associated &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt;
