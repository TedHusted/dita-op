<div><p>DITA concept topics answer "What is..." questions. Use
the concept topic to introduce the background or overview information for
tasks or reference topics. The concept topic has the restriction that following
a section or example, only other sections or examples are permitted
as content. For more details on when to use concept and other information
types, please refer to the DITA architectural specification.</p>

<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/concept.html">concept</a><br />
The &lt;concept&gt; element is the top-level element for a topic that answers the question what is? Concepts provide background information that users must know before they can successfully work with a product or interface. Often, a concept is an extended definition of a major abstraction such as a process or function. It might also have an example or a graphic, but generally the structure of a concept is fairly simple.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/conbody.html">conbody</a><br />
The &lt;conbody&gt; element is the main body-level element for a concept. Like the &lt;body&gt; element of a general &lt;topic&gt;, &lt;conbody&gt; allows paragraphs, lists, and other elements as well as sections and examples. But &lt;conbody&gt; has a constraint that a section or an example can be followed only by other sections or examples.</li>
</ol>

While much of the DITA architecture is built upon generic topics, it is generally better to use more specific information types (such as concept, task, or reference) when they are available.
