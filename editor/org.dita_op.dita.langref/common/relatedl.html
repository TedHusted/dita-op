<h1 class="topictitle1">Related links elements</h1>



<div><p>The related-links section of DITA topics is a special structure
that supports the navigational rules from a topic to its related neighbor
topics.</p>

<div class="section"><p>Links are different from cross-references in that cross-references
occur only within the body of a topic and can target any element in this or
other topics; links only represent topic-to-topic connections, or connections
to non-DITA-topic resources. Links are located after the body of a topic,
in the <a href="../langref/related-links.html" title="The related information links of a topic (&lt;related-links&gt; element) are stored in a special section following the body of the topic. After a topic is processed into it final output form, the related links are usually displayed at the end of the topic, although some Web-based help systems might display them in a separate navigation frame.">related-links</a> element.</p>
<p>Related
links can also be managed indirectly using DITA maps, which provide a more
efficient way to manage links as an aspect of the collection of topics rather
than as embedded pointers in each topic. </p>

<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/link.html">link</a><br />
The &lt;link&gt; element defines a relationship to another topic. Links represent the types and roles of topics in a web of information, and therefore represent navigational links within that web. Links are typically sorted on output based on their attributes. The optional container elements for link (&lt;linkpool&gt; and &lt;linklist&gt;) allow authors to define groups with common attributes, or to preserve the authored sequence of links on output. Links placed in a &lt;linkpool&gt; may be rearranged for display purposes (combined with other local or map-based links); links in a &lt;linklist&gt; should be displayed in the order they are defined. Refer to those elements for additional explanation.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/linklist.html">linklist</a><br />
The &lt;linklist&gt; element defines an author-arranged group of links. Within &lt;linklist&gt;, the organization of links on final output is in the same order as originally authored in the DITA topic.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/linkpool.html">linkpool</a><br />
The &lt;linkpool&gt; element defines a group of links that have common characteristics, such as type or audience or source. When links are not in a &lt;linklist&gt; (that is, they are in &lt;related-links&gt; or &lt;linkpool&gt; elements), the organization of links on final output is determined by the output process, not by the order that the links actually occur in the DITA topic.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/linktext.html">linktext</a><br />
The &lt;linktext&gt; element provides the literal label or line of text for a link. In most cases, the text of a link can be resolved during processing by cross reference with the target resource. Use the &lt;linktext&gt; element only when the target cannot be reached, such as when it is a peer or external link, or the target is local but not in DITA format. When used inside a topic, it will be used as the text for the specified link; when used within a map, it will be used as the text for generated links that point to the specified topic.</li>
<li class="olchildlink"><a href="../langref/linkinfo.html">linkinfo</a><br />
The &lt;linkinfo&gt; element allows you to place a descriptive paragraph following a list of links in a &lt;linklist&gt; element.</li>
